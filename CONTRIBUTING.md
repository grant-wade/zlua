# Contributing

zlua is compatibility-driven. When Lua-visible behavior is in question, use the official Lua 5.5 implementation as the oracle and add a regression test.

## Setup

Use Zig `0.16.0`.

```sh
zig version
zig build fetch-lua
```

`fetch-lua` downloads Lua 5.5 source and official tests into `.zlua-deps/`, which is ignored by Git.

## Workflow

For behavior changes:

1. Add or update a fixture, unit test, or embedding example.
2. Verify expected behavior against CLua when the behavior is Lua-visible.
3. Make the smallest implementation change that preserves compatibility.
4. Run a focused check first.
5. Run broader checks before submitting.

Default CI-equivalent check:

```sh
zig build ci
```

Format touched Zig files:

```sh
just fmt
```
